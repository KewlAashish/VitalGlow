1. The main branch of this repository is "master"

2. Now what is the workflow?

Step 0: Update master branch by taking the latest pull from the master branch
a. We create a new branch from "master" everytime we start making a feature
b. Once tested everything we merge this to master.

3. How to commit code?
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push -u origin <branch_name>

4. After successfully merging the feature branch to master we should delete the feature branch.
