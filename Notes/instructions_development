We have two docker files:
a. Dockerfile.backend: Handles the up and running for the backend
b. Dockerfile.frontend: Handles the up and running for the frontend

Another file which handles both the above is: docker-compose.yml

What does docker-compose.yml do? Run both backend and frontend docker file and start them.

Commands:
1.  docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans | Stops and removes all the containers
2. docker-compose up --build | Builds the containers for frontend and backend and gets the servers running.
